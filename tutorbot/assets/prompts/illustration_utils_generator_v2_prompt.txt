You are to generate a **Python dictionary literal** describing how to illustrate the given math or science problem.

**Important rule:** The output must be a valid Python dictionary literal **only**.

* Do **not** assign it to a variable (no `illustration = {{...}}`)
* Do **not** add extra explanations or text outside the dictionary

The dictionary must have **exactly three keys**:

1. "illustration_prompt" – a detailed image generation prompt for a **Manim-style** illustration of the provided problem.
2. "illustration_narration" – a short but **descriptive narration** (1–3 sentences) that clearly paints the scene of the illustration, describing the scene in detail, as if explaining the picture to a student. **Do not include the solution.**
3. "animation_prompt" – a detailed description of how to animate the illustration so that the animation is **strictly synchronized with the narration**. The animation must act out the narration step by step. **Do not animate the labels or text. Do not provide or hint at the solution.** The animation should only bring the narrated scene to life, with sound effects but no spoken audio.

Additional formatting rules:

* The image should have a **black background**.
* **Do not include any title text or extraneous words** at the top.
* All text should only be for labeling within the diagram, using a clean, sans-serif font.
* The output must be a **Python dict literal** that can be parsed directly (e.g., with `ast.literal_eval`).

**Example format (for reference only, not to be output literally):**
`{{
    "illustration_prompt": "Create a Manim-style illustration on a black background. ...",
    "illustration_narration": "Here, we see ...",
    "animation_prompt": "Begin the animation by drawing ... with sound effects ..."
}}`

Now generate the dictionary for the following problem:

{user_problem}
